# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an interactive dashboard to simplify the analysis of road accident data for the years 2021-2022. With a vast dataset containing numerous entries, the goal is to streamline the process of identifying trends, patterns, and potential outliers. The dashboard allows users to easily visualize key insights through graphs and charts, offering a comprehensive view of road accident statistics across various categories.

The analysis involves several key processes, including data filtering, cleaning, and aggregation, which are visualized using interactive tools such as slicers and timelines. This project is particularly useful for understanding accident severity, identifying contributing factors, and providing data-driven insights to inform decision-making.

## Key Features

1. **Data Filtering**  
   The data filtering feature allows users to detect inconsistencies or errors within the dataset. By filtering specific variables, such as accident type, vehicle involved, or road condition, users can focus their analysis on relevant subsets of the data.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   A critical part of the process involves cleaning the dataset by replacing incorrect or missing values. This ensures that the data used in the analysis is accurate and reliable. Duplicate entries and anomalies are identified and corrected to maintain consistency.

3. **Data Processing with Pivot Tables**  
   Pivot Tables are employed to efficiently summarize the accident data based on various criteria such as time, location, or type of accident. This allows for the aggregation of large datasets into digestible chunks, making it easier to analyze and interpret.

4. **Comprehensive Data Visualization**  
   The dashboard provides multiple visual representations of the data, including:
   - **Line Charts**: Show monthly trends for casualty numbers across different accident types.
   - **Bar Charts**: Compare accident severity (fatal, serious, slight) and casualties by vehicle type or road conditions.
   - **Pie Charts**: Visualize the proportion of casualties based on light conditions (daylight, night, etc.) or road surfaces (wet, dry, etc.).
   - **Slicer & Timeline Filters**: Allow users to drill down into specific time periods or categories, offering interactive insights that update in real time.

5. **Interactive Dashboard**  
   The Road Accident Dashboard consolidates all key metrics into one interactive interface. This ensures that users can seamlessly switch between different filters and visualize data tailored to their needs, enhancing decision-making and understanding of the trends.

## Metrics Explanation

### 1. **Fatal Casualties**
   Represents the total number of individuals who died as a result of road accidents during the specified period. This is a crucial metric for identifying high-risk areas or accident types.

### 2. **Serious Casualties**
   Counts the number of individuals who sustained serious injuries. This metric helps in understanding the severity of accidents and the types of accidents that are most dangerous.

### 3. **Slight Casualties**
   Refers to the number of individuals who sustained minor injuries. Monitoring this helps assess overall traffic safety and minor accident trends.

### 4. **Casualties by Vehicle Type**
   Breaks down the total number of casualties by the type of vehicle involved in the accident (e.g., car, motorcycle, etc.). This metric provides insight into which vehicle types are most frequently involved in accidents and may help in tailoring safety campaigns.

### 5. **Casualties by Road Type**
   This metric categorizes accidents based on the type of road or surface condition (wet, dry, etc.) where they occurred. Understanding road conditions helps in addressing infrastructure and road safety issues.

### 6. **Monthly Trend of Casualties**
   A line chart showing the fluctuation in the number of casualties per month over the selected period. It helps identify patterns or spikes in accidents, which could be tied to weather conditions, holidays, or other external factors.

### 7. **Casualties by Light Conditions**
   Displays how accidents are distributed based on light conditions (e.g., daylight, night with street lighting, night without street lighting). This provides insight into whether lighting conditions play a significant role in accident occurrence.

### 8. **Total Casualties**
   This is the aggregate count of all casualties, combining fatal, serious, and slight injuries. It provides a high-level overview of road safety for the selected period.
